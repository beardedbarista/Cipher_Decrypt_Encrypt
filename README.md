This Python script provides a simple decryption and encryption function for Caesar Ciphers. This is a substitution cipher that shift letters in the alphabet by a fixed key value.
A brute force function was also created incase the key was not known. This iterates over each of the 26 possibilities.

This script supports lower and uppercase letters.
Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged during decryption and encryption.
Feel free to use and modify these functions as need!
